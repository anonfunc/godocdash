# Godocdash

Generate Dash docset for Dash/Zeal from your local $GOPATH packages.

## Features

+ Support `Package`, `Type`, `Function`, `Constant`, `Variable` entry types of dash docsets currently.

+ You can set your own custom docset name and icon for different `$GOPATH`.

+ Concurrent generating, usally it only takes a few seconds to complete.

+ Go standard libraries are ignored, as there's `Go` docset in Dash/Zeal downloads already.

## How It Works

While running, `godocdash` will first start a temporary `godoc` server, then
find the package entries to grab the godoc pages, and generate the docset.

## Installing

```
go get github.com/thoeni/godocdash
```

And make sure `godoc` command is in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

Generally, just run:

```
godocdash
```

And a docset named *GoDoc.docset* will be generated in your current directory,
you can then place it into Dash/Zeal docsets path.

As `godocdash` directly passes your current environment variables to `godoc`,
you can change the source `$GOPATH` by setting it while running `godocdash`:

```
GOPATH=/another/gopath godocdash
```

You can also change the docset name and icon, or mute the output:

```
GOPATH=/another/gopath godocdash -icon 'new_icon.png' -name 'different name' -silent
```

It's also possible to specify a filter in order to generate a subset of the
documentation, by using the `-filter` flag.

Command line flags:

```
$ godocdash -h
Usage of godocdash:
   -filter string
          Specify a subdirectory you want to extract the docs for
    -icon string
          Docset icon .png path
    -name string
          Set docset name (default "GoDoc")
    -silent
          Silent mode (only print error)
```
